# Popularity Prediction from Spotify Dataset

This project aims to predict the popularity of songs based on various features extracted from the Spotify dataset. The primary predictors of popularity were found to be artist popularity and duration.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Spotify and contains information about various songs including their features and popularity ratings. It includes attributes like artist popularity, duration, danceability, energy, etc.

## Feature Importance

After analyzing the dataset, it was observed that the most important variables in predicting popularity were:
- Artist popularity
- Duration

## Algorithms Explored

Several machine learning algorithms were experimented with to build the predictive model. The algorithms used include:
- Random Forest
- Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## Best Model

Out of the algorithms tested, Random Forest yielded the best results with an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 81%.

## Results

The results of the predictive model, including evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, can be found in the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts.
